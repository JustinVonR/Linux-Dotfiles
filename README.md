# About My Dotfiles:

These dotfiles are designed for the i3 edition of EndeavourOS and require 
the following programs to be installed before using:

+ Polybar 
+ Terminator
+ Light (replaces xbacklight because it functions better in my case)

Changes Made to default EOS i3 scripts:

+ Removed hibernate from the power menu options in `powermenu` and switched it to use my customized rofi theme
+ Replaced xbacklight with light in `volume_brightness.sh` because xbacklight doesn't work for me

> [!IMPORTANT]
> My dotfiles are compatible with the latest updates as of 8/13/2023
